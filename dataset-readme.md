## 🧹 Cleaning Notes

* ✔️ Converted `Order Date` and `Ship Date` to `datetime` using `dayfirst=True` to ensure format accuracy
* ✔️ Cleaned and renamed columns to follow Python naming conventions (e.g., `Order_ID`, `Product_Name`)
* ✔️ Handled missing `Postal Code` values (`~80%` are null – safe to drop or exclude)
* ✔️ Verified numerical columns (`Sales`, `Profit`, `Shipping Cost`, etc.) are valid `float64` types
